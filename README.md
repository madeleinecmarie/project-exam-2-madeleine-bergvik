Holidaze is a hotelbooking site where you can book rooms, apartments and B&B's in Stavanger.  

## Description

I made this project for the project exam 2 in the last year in spring 2022. It is semi functional hotel booking website based in Stavanger called Holidaze. I designed it using Figma and the dark colours I used was inspired by the wet and harsh climate in the west coast of Norway. I coded it with use of Visual Studio Code, and the languages I used was, HTML, React, Next.js and SASS. I created my own API for the project using Strapi and deployed the local API using Heroku. Netlify was used to deploy the whole project.
